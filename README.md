Personal repository for pratice, for algorithm pratices and framework test codes. I am interested in several topic below these days. 

- [7L7W](http://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks) : Lean 7 Langauges in 7 Weeks. 
- [Code Kata](http://codekata.pragprog.com/) : Some peaces of programming problems, how to become better developer
- [SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) : " The magician book "
- [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) : Python toolkit for natual language processing.

- And test many interesting frameworks, for work but sometimes just for fun.
